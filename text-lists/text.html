        <h1><strong>The Giant Squid</strong></h1>
        
        <p>The giant squid (<em>genus: Architeuthis</em>) is a deep-ocean dwelling squid in the family Architeuthidae, represented by as many as eight species. Giant squid an grow to a tremendous size (<em>see Deep-sea gigantism</em>): recent estimates put the maximum size at 13 m (<em>43 ft</em>) for females and 10 m (<em>33 ft</em>) for males from the posterior fins to the tip of the two long tentacles (<em>second only to the colossal squid at an estimated 14 m (46 ft), one of the largest living organisms</em>). The mantle is about 2 m (<em>6.6 ft</em>) long (<em>more for females, less for males</em>), and the length of the squid excluding its tentacles is about 5 m (<em>16 ft</em>). Claims of specimens measuring 20 m (<em>66 ft</em>) or more have not been scientifically documented.</p>
        
        <p>On 30 September 2004, researchers from the <abbr title="Museum of Nature and Science">NMNS</abbr> of Tokyo, Japan and the <abbr title="Ogasawara Whale Watching Association">OWA</abbr> took the first images of a live giant squid in its natural habitat. Several of the 556 photographs were released a year later. The <abbr title="Museum of Nature and Science">NMNS</abbr> and <abbr title="Ogasawara Whale Watching Association">OWA</abbr> successfully filmed a live adult giant squid for the first time on 4 December 2006.</p>
